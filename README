AudioQs ReadMe.

Read lines 12 to 21 to quick start.

AudioQs is intended for visually impaired WoW players.
AudioQs provides methods for writing complex audio prompts, with timings, delays and conditionals, prompt restarters and segment repeaters.

It is not easy for most users to implement extensions onto this addon, because it has no user interface. 
A programmer will need to understand the data structure of the extensions to be able to write prompts. An example is shown in the Extensions\BeastMastery.lua file.
If you need specific extensions made, and you are visually impaired. You can make specific requests to me and I will get back to you asap. Please email me at zyewchi@gmail.com

Examples:
How to load an extension -- type these commands in chat:

/aq load HealthMonitor
will load the health monitor for healers extension into the current spec played.

/aq load BeastMastery
will load the beast mastery cooldowns and frenzy tracker into the current spec.

Capital letters do not matter.

Extensions are listed in the Extensions folder.

Why not use Weak Auras instead?
AudioQs is a hub for me to update blind-assist extensions as requested.

Please use Weak Auras for simple prompts if you prefer; you are not blind and you are familiar with WeakAuras; or somebody assisting you is familiar with WeakAuras. A simple prompt can be made with one trigger and a PlaySound condition in a WeakAura

AudioQs answers the problem of efficiency with complexity, but requires a dedicated LUA code writer, and AudioQs developer. These are hand-crafted for audio prompts. And have optimisations for situations where delays and timings are needed around PlaySound calls.
If, and only if, a programmer is familiar with the AudioQs system, it should be less work to write complex audio prompts in this system, than to write custom-coded weak auras.

That said, AudioQs is light-weight and can be extended to implement any complex prompting system, and some additional extras have been provied (/aq load killingblow).
